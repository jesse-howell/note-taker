# note-taker

## Description

This is an app that allows the user to take notes. I was motivated to create this app because I wanted to practice my skills with node.js and express.js. Though this is deployed it is not functional at this time. I learned how difficult linking the front and backend can be.

## Installation

Open the app via this [link](https://frozen-chamber-97474-56e12218f040.herokuapp.com/).
